## Connection Info
##
## Fill in the interface information for each of the servers
## For each of the servers mention the following details
## <server_ip_or_dns>:
##      control: <mandatory> Interface to use for control traffic
##      data: <mandatory> Interface to use for data traffic
##
## You may use the IP address or the hostname (if you have DNS).
## However, you need to be consistent as the installer tries match
## what you enter here against what you pass to net_demo_installer
## on the command line.
#CONNECTION_INFO:
#      <server1-ip-or-dns>:
#        control: eth1
#        data: eth2
#      <server2-ip-or-dns>:
#        control: eth7
#        data: eth2

## APIC Access Info

## Fill in the info and uncomment (quotes are needed)
#APIC_URL: "https://<apic-server-url>:443"
#APIC_USERNAME: "admin"
#APIC_PASSWORD: "password"
#APIC_PHYS_DOMAIN: "allvlans"

# The following two settings are for cases where BD has to be pre-defined.
# If you don't know what this means, then you probably need to leave it
# with the default values given below.
#APIC_EPG_BRIDGE_DOMAIN: "not_specified"
#APIC_CONTRACTS_UNRESTRICTED_MODE: "no"

# Topology information can be given following 3 ways.

# Full path of leaves:
#APIC_LEAF_NODES:
#    - topology/pod-1/node-101
#    - topology/pod-1/node-102

## When you want port binding, you can use following topology syntax.
#APIC_LEAF_NODES:
#    - topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/14]
#    - topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/15]
## Here we are binding to only eth1/14 and eth1/15 ports of leaf 101 as opposed to full leaf level binding in earlier case.

# You can give mix of both like this.
#APIC_LEAF_NODES:
#    - topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/14]
#    - topology/pod-1/paths-101/pathep-[eth1/15]
#    - topology/pod-1/node-102
